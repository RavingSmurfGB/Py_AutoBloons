# This if the configuration file for Py_AutoBloons, do not edit this section
#
#   XP_Monkey
#
#   Filling this option will enable you to choose a monkey for the program to place in game.
#   This tower will not provide any fuctionality but will help you to gain experiance points in that monkey,
#   allowing  for quicker leveling.
#   To see what towers are supported plese view bellow.
#   Example:
#       XP_Monkey: BOOMERANG
#
#
#   Logging
#
#   This option will allow for logging to a file, everything you see in your console will be logged to "game_log.txt".
#   This will be placed in the main directory. 
#   Only use this option for troubleshooting and reporting bugs!
#   Example:
#       Logging: True
#
#
#   Gameplan_file - not fully implemented
#   
#   This option allows for user configurable gameplans, once it has been recorded with gameplan_recorder.py copy the gameplan.csv into the same folder as Py_AutoBloons.py
#   Then simply specify the file name, feel free to rename the .csv file but make sure the value below matches this config file.
#   Example:
#       Gameplan_file: gameplan.csv
#
#
#   Auto_Hero_Select 
#   This options disables automatically selecting Obyn as a hero once the program starts. This is mainly used if a user has created their own gameplan.
#   By defualt this option is True, even if blank in this file.
#   Skins are not supported, be sure to only have the defualt Obyn skin equipted.
#   Example:   
#       Auto_Hero_Select: False
#
#
#   Path_to_Bloons_TD6:
#
#   This option tells the script where to start the game from, if this is empty it will assume that you will start the game manually.
#   However if it is filled it will check to see if Bloons TD6 is open, if not it will open it. 
#   Also if the path is not specified Auto Restart cannot be used.
#   To find this go to steam, open the entry for Bloons TD6 in your library, press the settings cog, under the menu manage, browse local files.
#   If the code crashed when this option is enabled you may have to put two back slashes in between each folder e.g. \\BloonsTD6\\BloonsTD6.exe
#   Example:
#       Path_to_Bloons_TD6: D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\BloonsTD6\BloonsTD6.exe
#
#
#   Auto_Restart_Enabled
#
#   This option allows the script to be restarted periodicly, this is usefull as the script can break occasionaly due to many factors.
#   The default configuration is false, however it is highly recomended to enable it.
#   The path to the Bloons TD6.exe must be provided for Auto_restart to be enabled
#   Example:
#       Auto_Hero_Select: True
#
#
#   Auto_Restart_Period
#
#   This option specifies the duration between script restarts, the default entry is every 2 hours unless specified.
#   This must be given in hours.
#   Example:
#       Auto_Restart_Period: 3
